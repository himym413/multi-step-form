## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used mobile-first approach in dealing with this challenge and I learned a lot about responsive design. Mainly, that I should keep my design as simple as possible in order to make it responsive, and to really know what I am working with, before making any changes to a certain device width.

### Continued development

Definitely want to keep focusing on working on responsive design.
